# Predicting_used_car_prices
Using machine learning to predict used car prices based on the data available on www.sahibinden.com

I'm planning to sell my car which is a 4-year-old wolkswagen polo. Used cars are usually sold on a website called "sahibinden" in Turkey. "Sahibinden" means "from the owner" although there are many dealers using this website to sell or buy used cars. The most critical part of selling a used car is to determine the optimal price. There are many websites that give you a price for used cars but you still want to search the market before setting the price. Moreover, there are other factors which affect the price such as location, how fast you want to sell the car, smoking in the car and so on. Before you post your ad on the website, it is best to look through the price of similar cars. However, this process might be exhausting because there are too many ads online. Therefore, I decided to take advantage of the convenience offered by machine learning to create a model that predicts used car prices based on the data available on "sahibinden".
